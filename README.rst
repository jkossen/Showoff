Showoff features and lack thereof
----------------------------------

* Non-destructive: Showoff does not change original files

* Image rotation based on exif data

* Image albums are just directories with image files, showoff will find and
  generate the required metadata for you.

* You can use the admin to select which photo's should be published in the
  "show" which is the publicly visible album

* Separate frontend and admin apps

* No database is used (everything is in flat-file or json files)

* Theme support (Jinja2 is used for templates)

Installation
------------

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Showoff requires the following software:

* `Python`_ (developed with 2.5 provided with Debian Lenny)
* `Flask`_
* Flask-WTF
* py_bcrypt
* `Werkzeug`_
* `Jinja2`_
* PIL

If you use pip and virtualenv (highly recommended), you can simply install the
dependencies with

::

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt    

Installation Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Install the software listed under `Requirements`_
* Adjust the configuration in config.py
* Make sure the CACHE_DIR is writable by both the admin and viewer apps
* Make sure the EDITS_DIR and SHOWS_DIR are readable by the viewer app and
  readable AND writable by the admin app

I recommend using a combination of uwsgi and nginx. See the examples dir for
relevant wsgi files.
